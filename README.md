irc-bot
=======

This is an IRC bot coded in vb.net that responds to commands and does other various things.<br>
The base I used can be found @ http://jakash3.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/simple-vb-net-and-csharp-irc-client/, so all credits to jakasha3 for the original piece.

Current Features
=======

Currently it just grabs a user's reddit karma and displays it. Here's an example.<br>
<bcpu>!karma hueypriest<br>
<karmabot> hueypriest has 170,121 link & 80,935 comment karma.<br>

TODO
=======
I'm currently adding an ascii function that prints from local file. The ascii art found at - http://hawkee.com/snippet/8919/- will come with the bot. 

I'm going to add some other features for a few different sites. If you have any ideas or suggestions have at it. :]
